What we have:


- Tiny example where close form is known (Exp -> Uni)
  - @DeclareFactor
  - connecting stuff (references and reflection)
  - setting things as observed
  - running the sampler
- How factors work (Gamma?)
  - @FactorArgument, logDensity()
  - @FactorComponent
  - Generics
- Testing
  - GenerativeFactor
  - CheckStationarity
  - Unit testing
- Building a new samplers for an existing datatype (positive length)
  - @Samplers
  - Factor matching strategy
- Supporting new types of variables
  - Walk through of the CRP
- Processors
