Development notes
-----------------


Bayonet.mcmc provides useful ways of creating probabilistic models and for doing mcmc inference on them.

The models are assumed to be factor graphs with arbitrary arities and data types.

Factor graphs are bipartite undirected graphs with two types of nodes: factors and variables. Each factor computes onbe factor in a target unnormalized density broken into a product of factors. Each variable holds one coordinate of a state.

Each variable can be an object of any type. There are no types requirement. Variables are to be updated in place, so they are not immutable. While this is generally not a good programming practice, MCMC imposes performance constraints that support this design decision. 

Each variable should also override .equals() and .hashCode() to take into account the current internal state of the variable.

ACTUALLY: can probably use hashcode as a hashcode for testing

Factors are defined as classes that implement the interface ``Factor``. A factor should contain one or several references to variables. Each such reference should be marked using the annotation @FactorArgument. The rationale for this is explained below.

Implementing ``Factor`` only requires being able to compute the log of the factor density for the current configuration of the variables. 

While Factors keep pointers to variables, note that Variables should not keep pointers to factors. The rationale is that one type of variable (e.g. RealVariable) can be connected to a wide range of types of factors (not only univariate distribution, for example, a RealVariable could be a concentration parameter on a Dirichlet Process prior).

At the same time, when building MCMC moves it is often useful to access all the factors connected to a given variable. In order to make this easier, the pointers to variables held by factors are annotated so that the probability model can automatically determine the relevant back pointers, via the method ``ProbabilityModel.neightbors(Object variable)``.

A ProbabilityModel is built by adding Factors. Variables are automatically added by following the annotated fields in Factors.

Note that the probability model maintains various status information for each Variable. Only a subset of the variables discovered via the @FactorArgument annotation are stochastic. The other ones can be thought as hyper-parameters. 

By default, variables are not stochastic. To change this, set a parameter in the variable annotation: ``@FactorArgument(makeStochastic = true)``. Here is an example of the most common case: if a factor f encodes a relation of the form f(x,y) = p(x|y), then x would have the makeStochastic parameter set to true in the declaration of x in f, but not y.

A subset of the stochastic variables can be set as observed. A stochastic variable can be set to observed via ``ProbabilityModel.setObserved(variable)``. Stochastic variables that are not observed are called latent. Only the latent stochastic variables are sampled in an MCMC algorithm.


--- Design pattern when building factor: parameterization and generics

### Notes for exercise 4

- Practical question: implement sum product
- Theoretical question: show sum product computes the correct normalization

- Theoretical question: show reversibility implies arbitrary rooting is ok
- Theoretical question: show irreducibility of simple move set
- Theoretical question?: accept ratio of branch resampling?
- Practical question: tree MCMC

- ?? Theoretical question with Blang
- ?? Practical question with Blang

###

deterministic functions: 2 cases

- reparemetization: cleaner to handle with interfaces (makes code more readable, simplifies the framework)
- obs is sum: use special samplers/factors for that

Interesting case to think about: reversible, normalized rate matrix

###

Rate Matrix

Issues: normalization/not normalized, reversible/not reversible

interface RateMatrix:
double [][] getRateMatrix

interface ReversibleRateMatrix implements RateMatrix

class LogLinearReversibleRateMatrix implemenets ReversibleRateMatrix


####

TODO:

- Finish phylogenetic skeleton
- Blang: refactor of the Factor machinery


- resimplify Factor
- reintroduce SubModel… maybe not, the bound idea was pretty good


### Where does internal caching go?

- variable? - yeah, why not --  in phylo case, need access to factors
- factors? - ok, but note that need listener pattern for variable changes
		instead of listeners, use hashcode/equal

- moves: probably not

### Making sure we do break if equal has been overwridden!

Easy: but IMPORTANT: use identity hash map implementations
or, wrap variable/factor into node

question: should we manage the 


### Plan to handle deterministic relations:

create potential between the pair of node
introduce specialized sampler


### Plan for verification

check likelihood gets back to original value
getting it right

### Plan for checkpoints

will need some care when reading to recreate object structure 
from graph
default is json in zip file, add other hooks later

### Annotation-based creation of models

Introduce @AddToModel annotation

### Caching

(later)

### Bounds

(later)
Have factors and/or variables declare bounds, have samplers look for them

### Initialize with forward sim

### Check values of @FactorArgument are not primitives


### Naming

Use the name of the field, for which it is not defined if possible?

Old model
=========

Creating models
---------------

@Submodel
Factor

Creating factors
----------------

@FactorArgument
@FactorArgument(makeStochastic=true)
Factor.getLogDensity()
@FactorComponent

Creating moves
--------------

@RandomVariable(mcmcMoves = {..})
@SampledVariable
@ConnectedFactor

Creating variables
------------------

Main things to do is creating move


Next changes
============

X Better Factor hierarchy (still keep root)
X Introduce @Factor, automatically recurse
X Create moves via constructors, NO, current version just fine
X @RandomVariable -> @DefaultSamplers(..)
- Refactor dist, observation generation stuff


- start doc for blang

- need some test cases:
  - generation tricks [for full and subsets; use last digits of hashcode?? and/or loglikelihood]
  - randomness fixing test
  - in MH, check rejection give back the same score
  - later, when save/retreive, check score is the same
  - Checking that different moves do the same thing


- create abstract base class
- logging, nice plotting, etc
- refactor ProbabilityModel/keep Field objects around/better wrapping of variable?
- facilities for check point
- deterministic sampling stuff

- create other distributions
